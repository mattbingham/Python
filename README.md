#Python
Python training, I'm learning the Python programming language at the moment. I'll be adding scripts here as I have new ideas for them. I do not (currently) consider myself a programmer, I'm creating these small programs to solve a problem for myself. If you have any comments or suggestions I would love to hear them - mattbingham@outlook.com.

##Scripts
- `dog-owner.py` - Add a dog and dog tag. Associate dog with an owner.
- `simple-calulator.py` - Takes two number inputs and calculates them according to another user input.
