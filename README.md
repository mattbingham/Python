# Python
Hi, my name's Matt and I'm learning the Python programming language. I've read a lot of books, webpages and forums but I'm in need of more hands-on work, so rather than following guides - I'll be adding scripts here as I have new ideas for them and coding them from stratch. I do not (currently) consider myself a programmer, I'm creating these small programs to solve a problem for myself. If you have any comments or suggestions I would love to hear them - mattbingham@outlook.com.

## Scripts

### Completed scripts
_These are working but need some re-factoring to tidy things up_
- `dice-roll.py` - A random number from 1 - 6 is generated. User is asked how many rolls are required and each roll is shown in output.

- `dog-owner.py` - Add a dog of a particular breed, then associate owner of the dog.

- `miles-km-conversion.py` - Allows user to choose a conversion from km to miles or miles to km.

- `simple-calulator.py` - Takes two number inputs and calculates them according to another user input.

- `web-scraper_headings.py` - Finds all headings on a user inputted url.

- `web-scraper_advanced.py` - Asks user what should be output from defined input (headings, href etc.).

### Script ideas (work in progress)
- `adventure-game.py` - Simple text based game whereby user has to get home.

- `hangman.py` - User has to guess radom word within x amount of tries.

- `number-guess.py` - User guesses random number. Feedback states higher or lower.

- `story-generator.py` - Accepts several user inputs and prints pre-defined story using this input.


- `web-scraper_links.py` - Finds all links (and attributed link text) headings on a user inputted url

- `www_simple.py` - Displays a visual page in a web browser

- `www_form.py` - Displays a visual form in a web browser and sends email with input information

- `www_menu.py` - Displays visual pages depending on what menu link is clicked

- `www_authentication.py` - Displays form for register or login. Login will authenicate against database 

## Things I need to learn
I have much to learn to complete my goal of becoming a programmer. One thing that stuck out is the need to code things for myself - without the need for guides (but still checking around the web how to solve problems. Books and forums are great but at the moment coding doesn't come naturally to me. I love it when a tutorial or fact sticks and I can recall it without having to go back to a book or website. As well as listing coding items I need to learn, I thought it would be useful to list ideas, best practices and more - everything that can help me be a better programmer.

### Code stuff

- Classes. I can work with definitions but have a few problems when trying to call them inside of classes
- GUI / web app. I am great at asking for user input on cmd line(!) but how do I put all of this into a GUI or web app?
- Forms.
- Databases.
- Authentication. May need external library

### Other stuff

- Best practices for OOP
- Scaffolding to help build web applications (my main aim)

Feedback welcome!
